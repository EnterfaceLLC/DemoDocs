5.9.02 SIEVE ANALYSIS OF AGGREGATES (Kansas Test Method KT-02)

**1. SCOPE**

This method of test covers procedures for the determination of the particle size distribution of aggregates
using standard sieves. **KT-02** reflects testing procedures found in **AASHTO T 27**.

**2**. **REFERENCED DOCUMENTS**

**2.1.** Part V, 5.9; Sampling and Test Methods Foreword

**2.2.** KT-01; Sampling and Splitting of Aggregates

**2.3.** KT-03; Material Passing No. 200 (75Œºm) Sieve by the Wash Method

**2.4.** ASTM E11; Woven Wire Test Sieve Cloth and Test Sieves

**2.5.** AASHTO T 27; Sieve Analysis of Fine and Coarse Aggregates

**3. APPARATUS**

**3.1.** The balance shall be readable to 0.1% of the sample mass and conform to the requirements of **Part V,
Section 5.9; Sampling and Test Methods Foreword** of this manual for the class of general purpose
balance required for the principal sample mass of the sample being tested.

**3.2.** Sieves meeting **ASTM E11**. As a minimum, set of sieves will include the 3/8 in (9.5 mm), No. 4 (4.
mm), No. 8 (2.36 mm), No. 16 (1.18 mm), No. 30 (600 Œºm), No. 50 (300 Œºm), No. 100 (150 Œºm) and No.
200 (75 Œºm) for all aggregates. Gradations with larger sized aggregate will require addition of appropriate
larger sieves to the set.

**3.3.** A mechanical sieve shaker shall impart a vertical, or lateral and vertical motion to the sieve, causing
the particles to bounce and turn so as to present different orientations to the sieving surface. The sieving
action shall be such that the criterion for adequacy of sieving is met in a timely manner as described in
**Section 9.** of this test method**.**

**3.4.** An oven of appropriate size capable of maintaining a uniform temperature of 230 ¬± 9¬∞F (110 ¬± 5¬∞C).

**3.5.** Drying pans.

**4. SAMPLES**

**4.1.** Composition: Obtain samples for sieve analysis by the use of a sample splitter or by the method of
quartering. Fine aggregate sampled by the quartering method shall be thoroughly mixed and in a moist
condition. The sample for test shall be approximately the mass desired and shall be the end result of proper
reduction methods. Do not attempt the selection of samples of an exact predetermined mass.

**4.2.** Fine Aggregates: Sample of fine aggregate for sieve analysis shall have a mass, after drying, not less
than 300 g.

**4.3.** Coarse Aggregate: Samples of coarse aggregate and mixtures of coarse and fine aggregate for sieve
analysis shall have a mass, after drying, not less than the amounts indicated in **Table 1**.

```
**NOTE:** To select the sample size, use the largest sieve on which 5% or more of the material is specified to
be retained.

**NOTE:** 12.00 in (300 mm) diameter sieves should be used for testing coarse aggregates and in testing
samples with a mass of 5,000 g or more. If 12.00 in (300 mm) diameter sieves are not available, the split
sample procedure in **Section 7.2** of this test method shall be used.

**5. PREPARATION OF SAMPLES**

**NOTE:** Remove deleterious material prior to determining the total original dry mass of sample if required
by relevant specifications.

**5.1.** Dry all samples to a constant mass at a temperature of 230 ¬± 9¬∞F (110 ¬± 5¬∞C). Determine the mass of
the sample to the nearest 0.1% of the sample mass. Record this as the total original dry mass of sample.

**5.1.1.** In the case of Cold in Place Recycle, air drying is acceptable.

**5.2.** Wash the sample over the No. 200 (75Œºm) sieve as specified in **KT-0 3**. Then redry the sample to
constant mass. Determine the mass of the sample to the nearest 0.1% of the total original dry mass of
sample. Record this as the dry mass of sample after washing.

**NOTE:** For lightweight aggregate cover material: Dry-screen lightweight aggregate cover material
according to **KT-0 4** instead of washing. Remove and discard all deleterious material from the sample
including clay lumps retained on the No.4 (4.75 mm) sieve before the mass of the sample after dry-
screening is determined.

**5.3.** For convenience, mixtures of coarse and fine aggregates may be separated into two portions by
screening the dried sample over a No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.

**5.3.1** Reduce the material passing the No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve by means of a sample splitter to a mass of
approximately 1,000 g. Wash both the coarse and reduced fine portions of the total sample in accordance
with **KT-0 3** and conduct a sieve analysis on each portion. Calculate the total combined grading in
accordance with subsection **Section 7.2** of this test method.

## 6. TEST PROCEDURES

**6.1.** Nest the sieves in order of decreasing size of opening from top to bottom and place the sample, or
portion of the sample, if it is to be sieved in more than one increment, on the top sieve. Agitate the sieves
by mechanical sieve shaker for a sufficient period, established by trial or checked by measurement on the
actual test sample, to meet the criterion for adequacy of sieving described in **Section 10.** of this test method.

**6.1.1.** If a mechanical sieve shaker is not used, follow the procedures for hand sieving in **Section 1 1**.

**6.2.** Limit the quantity of material on a given sieve so that all particles have opportunity to reach sieve
openings a number of times during the sieving operation. For sieves with openings smaller than No. 4 (4.
mm) the mass retained on any sieve at the completion of the sieving operation shall not exceed 4 g/in^2 (
kg/m^2 ) of sieving surface. For sieves with openings No. 4 (4.75 mm) and larger, the mass in kg/m^2 of
sieving surface shall not exceed the product of 2.5 times the sieve opening in mm. In no case shall the mass
be so great as to cause permanent deformation of the sieve cloth.

**NOTE:** The 4 g/in^2 (7 kg/m^2 ) amounts to 200 g for the usual 8 in (203 mm) diameter sieve and 450 g for
a 12 in (305 mm) diameter sieve. The amount of material retained on a sieve may be regulated by (1) the
introduction of a sieve with larger openings immediately above the given sieve or (2) testing the sample in
a number of increments.

**6.3.** In the case of coarse and fine aggregate mixtures, the portion of the sample finer than the No. 4
(4.75 mm) sieve may be distributed among two or more sets of sieves to prevent overloading of individual
sieves.

**6.3.1.** Alternatively, the portion finer than the No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve may be reduced in size using a
mechanical splitter according to **KT-01, Section 4.2**. If this procedure is followed, compute the mass of
each size increment of the original sample as outlined in **Section 7.2.** of this test method.

**6.4.** Determine the mass of each sieve size increment to the nearest 0.1% of the total original dry mass of
sample (as defined in **Section 5.1.** of this test method) by weighing on a scale or balance conforming to the
requirements specified in **Section 3.1.** of this test method**.** The total mass of the material after sieving
should check closely with the original mass of sample placed on the sieves. If the amounts differ by more
than 0.3%, based on the original mass of sample placed on the sieves, the results should not be used for
acceptance purposes.

**6.5.** If the sample has previously been tested by **KT-03** , add the mass finer than the No. 200 (75 Œºm) sieve
determined by that method to the mass passing the No. 200 (75 Œºm) sieve by sieving of the same sample in
this method.

## 8. REPORTING

The results of the sieve analysis and, when required, the percent passing the No. 200 (75 Œºm) sieve by the
Wash Method ( **KT-03** ) are reported on appropriate KDOT forms. Report gradation test results to the
nearest whole percent, except when the percentage passing the No. 200 (75 Œºm) sieve is less than 10%. In
this case, both the percentage passing the No. 200 (75 Œºm) sieve and the material retained on the No. 200
(75 Œºm) sieve shall be reported to the nearest 0.1%. Note that some specifications require these values be
reported to the 0.01% such as asphalt mix gradations. The project number, name of producer, location of
deposit, and all other pertinent data are shown on each report.

The first aggregate report issued for each project shall list the laboratory number under which the latest
Official Quality Sample was tested and the results of such tests with the exception that specific gravities
will be reported only if required by the specification. Subsequent reports may list only the laboratory
number which the quality tests were conducted.

**10. VERIFICATION OF MECHANICAL SIEVE SHAKER EFFICIENCY**

**10.1.** The following procedure defines a methodology to verify the efficiency of mechanical sieve shaker
equipment. This procedure should be applicable to any manufacturers mechanical sieve shaker but has not
been verified internally at KDOT.

**10.1.1.** Shaker efficiency is a requirement for all acceptance testing of fine and coarse aggregate and should
be determined based on each product type. As aggregate production and mining operations can cause a
change to aggregate properties (soundness, durability, angularity and specific gravity), re-evaluation of
shaker efficiency shall be required.

**10.1.2.** Measurement of shak er efficiency is required for all sieves 12-in. diameter or smaller.

**NOTE ‚Äì** Screens larger than 12-in. diameter, i.e. 14 x14 in. or 16 x 24 in., are typically use d for aggregate
separation and accurate measurement of sieving efficiency may be difficult to determine.

**10 .1.3.** Nest the sieves, No. 4 and smaller, according to product being evaluated. Fit the sieve nest with a
lid and a pan.

**10 .1.4.** Determine the initial mass of the sample and shake for 6 minutes or by the time established by
product history.

**10 .1.5.** Determine and record the percent retained of each sieve size. Verify the material on each sieve does
not exceed the maximum allowable mass per **6.2.** If overloaded, r epeat using an adjusted sample mass.

**10 .1.6.** Collect and recombine all of the material.

**10 .1.7.** Re-shake the collected material using the same shaker and settings and increase the time by 1
minute.

**10 .1.8.** Determine and record the percent retained of each sieve size.

**1 0. 1.9.** Compare the percent retained to the percent retained in 10 .1.5. The difference between two
percent retained values on any sieve shall not exceed 0.5 percent by mass. If the difference between the two
percent


Page 8/9 5.9.0 2 2022
Revised 2022

retained values on any screen exceeds 0.5 percent by mass, then increase the shaker time another minute
and repeat the process until the requirement can be met.

**10 .1.10.** Record the minimum shaker time in which the requirement outlined in 10.1.9 is met as the
established shaker time for the aggregate product being evaluated. This established shake time shall be used
for testing this product in accordance with the procedure established in **Section 6**. For example, if the
requirement was met when placed in the shaker for 6 and then 7 minutes, then the 6 minute time on the
shaker provides adequate sieving.

**11.HAND SIEVING (OPTIONAL)**

**11 .1.** Sieving for a sufficient period and in such a manner that, after completion, not more than 0.5% by
mass of the total sample passes any sieve during one minute of continuous hand sieving performed as
follows: Hold the individual sieve, provided with a snug fitting pan and cover, in a slightly inclined position
in one hand. Strike the side of the sieve sharply and with an upward motion against the heel of the other
hand at the rate of about 150 times per minute, turn the sieve about one-sixth of a revolution at intervals of
about 25 strokes. In determining sufficiency of sieving for sizes larger than the No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve,
limit the material on the sieve to a single layer of particles. If the size of the mounted testing sieves makes
the described sieving motion impractical, use 8 in (203 mm) diameter sieves to verify the sufficiency of
sieving.

**11 .2.**^1 An alternative to maintain a snug fitting pan and cover is to sieve the material over an oversized pan.
The pan must be large enough to ensure all material is retained during the hand sieving process. Any
material leaving the sieve over the top of the rim must be returned to the sieve.

**11.3.** Once hand sieving is complete return to **Section 6.4** to complete the test procedure.

(^1) **11.2.** is not found in **AASHTO T 27** but provides a realistic approach to monitoring material falling thru the sieve.
